# xfce4-screenshooter

Xfce4-screenshooter allows you to capture the entire screen, the active
window or a selected region. You can set the delay that elapses
before the screenshot is taken and the action that will be done with
the screenshot: save it to a /PNG file, copy it to the clipboard, open
it using another application, or host it on imgur.com,
a free online image hosting service.
