=== Version 1.7.9 ===

  * The XMLRPC-C dependency has been replaced by libsoup.
  * Gtk 2.14 is now required to compile.
  * Switch to a non-recursive Makefile.am. This reduces the build time
    and centralizes the build information.

  * New features:
    - Scrolling the panel plugin button changes the area to be captured.
    - When compositing is on, use a nice partially transparent rubber-banding,
      still needs some polishing.
    - F1 opens the help page.
    - Automatically fill the title and comment fields in the ZimageZ upload
      information dialog.
    - Make enter validate the upload in the ZimageZ upload information dialog.
    - Use the XDG image directory as the default directory for saving
      screenshots. If it does not exist, fallback to $HOME.
    - Major interface rethinking:
      + This new interface is based on a suggestion by Yves-Alexis Pérez. The
        former main dialog is split into two dialogs: one for selecting the
        region to be captured and the delay, while the second one displays a
        preview of the screenshot and lists the available actions.
      + The main application shows the first dialog, then the second one. If
        one of the region CLI options is given, the screenshot is taken
        accordingly and the second dialog is displayed.
      + The panel plugin uses the first dialog as a configuration dialog. When
        you click the plugin, the screenshot is taken and the second dialog is
        shown.
    - Allow drag and dropping of the preview to other applications in order to
      paste the screenshot (Mike Massonnet).

  * Bugs fixed:
    - UTF-8 characters in user name or password caused a login failure.
    - Fix all warnings triggered by running autogen.sh.
    - Fix the ZimageZ upload when behind a proxy.
    - Fix copying of links in the ZimageZ upload finished dialog.
    - Fix 100% CPU usage when selecting a region in a non composited
      environment (spotted by Gauvain Pocentek).
    - When capturing a window with rounded corners, don't capture the
      background of the window but make the screenshot transparent instead.
    - Make sure the save folder in the panel plugin preferences is valid.
    - Don't show the copy to clipboard option in the application if no
      clipboard manager is running as the screenshot won't be preserved
      after closing the application anyway in that case.
    - Allow xfce4-screenshooter -r to be used as a command for a keybinding.
    - Allow silent build.
    - Fix most pre-build warnings.
    - Escape screenshots path when opening them with an application.
    - Plug some leaks in the application and in the panel plugin.
    - Do not accept conflicting CLI options. Warn the user when he uses
      CLI options which are not coherent.
    - Correctly save preferences, even if the rc file does not exist 
      (Mike Massonnet).
    - One second is now the minimal delay when using the interactive
      mode. This caused the screenshooter dialog to be partially displayed
      on the screenshot in some cases.

  * A lot of updated translations for the application, the panel plugin and the
    documentation. Thanks to the Xfce translation team!

=== Version 1.6.0 ===

  Gtk+ 2.12 and Glib 2.16 are now required to build the application
  and the panel plugin. Xml-rpc and libcurl are now optionnal dependencies,
  they should be replaced by libsoup in the future.

  * Bugs fixed:
    - The cursor was missplaced when taking a screenshot of a window (Bug #5204).

  * Enhancements:
    - Add an optional action to host screenshots on ZimageZ, a free online image
      hosting solution.
    - Add an option in the user interface to hide the mouse pointer on screenshots.
    - Add an option in the application which allows the user to choose
      whether the application should be closed after taking a screenshot. This
      allows the user to take several screenshots in a row.
    - New user interface based on Fabrice Viale's review. The dialog now has a
      two column layout which makes it more appealing and more usable.
    - Add a CLI option to hide the mouse pointer on screenshots.
    - When selecting a region to be screenshooted, you can now use the Escape
      keyboard key to cancel the operation.
    - Screenshots can now be saved to remote locations that are connected using
      gvfs-connect or Gigolo.
    - Updated translations for the application and the documentation.

      be annoying.
    - fix build without Gio (#4894).
    - do not use a verb for the desktop file title (#4914).
    - set the correct folder in the filechooser when using the -s CLI
      option. Thanks to Enrico Tröger.

    - also take the mouse pointer when taking a screenshot.
    - plug a remaining leak.

=== Version 1.4.90 ===

  The application is now named "Xfce4 Screenshooter", the adress of the
  SVN trunk has changed and the one of the website too. See the README
  file. xfce4-panel dependency has been bumped to >= 4.4.

  * Bugfixes:
    - correctly grab active windows. In particular, menus are grabbed
      now (bug #4611).
    - correctly save the preferences, even if ~/.config/xfce4 does
      not exist. Thanks to Nick Schermer for the explanations.
    - when saving the screenshot fails, show an error dialog
      explaning why it failed.
    - fix some remaining crashes when taking a screenshot of the active
      window.
    - only read the preferences file once when opening the application.
    - don't automatically set filenames in the file chooser, as user set
      ones are overriden (bug #4748).

  * Enhancements:
    - Use -V for the version CLI option.
    - Add possibility to copy the screenshot to the clipboard, thanks to
      David Collins.
    - Add possibility to define region to be captured using the mouse,
      thanks to David Collins.
    - Add CLI options for the region selection and to open the
      screenshot with an application.
    - The dialog for the plugin preferences and the application has been
      totally rewritten to improve the user interface: it should look
      cleaner and tooltips have been added. Work started by David
      Collins.
    - When using delay, detect the area to screenshot after the delay,
      and not before, as it caused weird results in some cases.
    - Add a documentation accessible from the application and the panel
      plugin.
